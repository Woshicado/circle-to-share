# Circle to Share

> [!WARNING]
> **Built with AI/LLM assistance.**
>
> This app was written by Fable 5 (which curiously fell back to Opus 4.8).
> Expect the kinds of mistakes LLMs typically make.
> Review the code before relying on it, and please report anything that looks off.

Grab the screen from anywhere, crop it, share it — without saving anything to your device. A replacement for the share flow Google removed from Circle to Search.

Trigger it → the screen freezes → circle what you want → **Share** or **Copy**. The crop lives only in the app's private cache (auto-cleaned after an hour); nothing ever hits your gallery.

The loop's outline becomes a crop box you can resize and reposition. Prefer dragging a rectangle directly? Turn off **Circle to crop** in the app.

## Triggering it

Use any of these:

- **Power button (press & hold)** — works via the digital-assistant role.
- **Swipe up from a bottom corner** — another way to invoke the digital assistant, if enabled in your system settings.
- **Floating bubble** — an optional, always-on-screen draggable button (toggle in the app). Tap it to capture from any app.
- _Or any other way that starts your digital assistant_

## How it works

- The app registers as a **digital assistant** (`VoiceInteractionService`). Whatever launches the assistant — a press-and-hold of the power button, or a swipe up from a bottom corner — now opens the crop overlay instead of Gemini/Google.
- The system hands assistants a screenshot of the current screen (`onHandleScreenshot`), the same mechanism Circle to Search uses. On devices/ROMs that don't provide it to third-party assistants, an **accessibility service** (`AccessibilityService.takeScreenshot`) captures instead.
- Shared images go out through a `FileProvider` URI backed by `cacheDir`; requiring no storage permission, no gallery entry, no cleanup chores.
- **Snap to screen content** (optional, off by default): when enabled, crop edges snap to the buttons, cards, and images that were on screen, read from the accessibility node tree. Element *positions* are read once, at the moment of capture, solely to align the crop box — nothing is stored or transmitted. This is why the accessibility service declares the "retrieve window content" capability; leave the toggle off and the bounds are never read at all.

## Build & install

With [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (pins JDK 17 automatically):

```sh
mise run build                    # debug APK
mise run deploy --build           # build debug, then install on a connected device (adb)
mise run deploy --build --release # build the signed release, then install it
mise run deploy                   # install the newest existing APK (debug or release)
```

Or directly with Gradle:

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Or open the project in Android Studio and hit Run.

## Permissions

None. The APK declares **zero** permissions — no internet, storage, camera, mic, or location.
Screen capture is granted implicitly by the assistant/accessibility bindings, and sharing goes through a `FileProvider`, so nothing extra is needed.

## Setup on the phone

1. Open the app and follow the three steps:
   1. **Set as assistant**: Settings → Apps → Default apps → Digital assistant app → *Circle to Share*. If a "Use screenshot" toggle appears there, turn it on.
   2. **Enable the fallback** (recommended): Settings → Accessibility → *Circle to Share* → turn on the master **Use** toggle. Only needed if step 1 alone shows "Couldn't get a screenshot".
   3. **Test** with the in-app button, then try the real gesture from any app.

> [!NOTE]
> **"Restricted setting" blocking the accessibility toggle?**
>
> Because the app is sideloaded (installed outside an app store), Android blocks it from enabling accessibility until you explicitly allow it.
> If the toggle is greyed out or you see *"Restricted setting"*, go to **Settings → Apps → Circle to Share → ⋮ (top-right menu) → Allow restricted settings**, then return to Accessibility and enable the **Use** toggle.

## Notes

- Apps that set `FLAG_SECURE` (banking, DRM video) can't be captured.
- Tapping outside the selection clears it; with no selection, **Share full** sends the entire screen.
- "Copy" puts the image on the clipboard (paste into messengers via Gboard etc.).
- Shortcuts in the overlay: **double-tap inside** the box shares, **long-press inside** copies, **double-tap on empty space** (nothing selected) exits. The top hint becomes tappable when your previous crop fits the new capture — tap it to restore that exact box.
- After an update that changes the accessibility service's declared capabilities (e.g. adding snap-to-content), Android may switch the service off — just re-enable it in Settings → Accessibility.
